# AskReddit_Bot

The original intent of making this app was to use Machine Learning (MBinarizer) to understand the questions in order to predict the upvotes a new post will get on the Ask_reddit subreddit.

---

  Objectives :
  
     1. To understand the metrics of reddit rating system and emulate it.
     2. Accurately predict the amount of upvotes a new post is going to get based on the above understood metrics.

  Tools:
  
     1. Python
     2. Machine Learning
     3. Multilabel Binarizer
     4. Pandas
     5. Numpy
     6. Data Visualization
     7. Data Extraction and parsing.

  Shortcomings:
    
     1. The problem initially was looking solvable with smaller hiccups through the first week. Unfortunately after a lot of speculation i found the naviety on my part was to   underestimate the Randomness of the post on r/ask_reddit.
     2. Hence it was impossible to make a accurate model of the questions and emulate the rating system.
